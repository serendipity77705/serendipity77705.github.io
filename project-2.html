                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the very first coding project that I had to do. It was for CSCI 1105, where we had to make an arcade game using a program called Processing. 
                    If you are unfamiliar with Processing, you can read more about it <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank"> here</a>. 
                    The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to navigate Processing and make a funtioning program out of it. 
                    For this assignment, I chose to create a two-player game wherein one person controls one square through the arrows and the othr conrols the other square through the aswd keys, and whoever got to 10 points by touching the circles wins. 
                    I have a demonstration of its working at the bottom of this page, and if you would like to skip to it, then just click <a href="#video">here</a>.

                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    This game took from me about 50 hours to finish. Implementation on Processing was relatively simple and easy, and all the commands were for the most part straightforward. 
                    While coding on Processing is very different from coding in a Java IDE like IntelliJ (if you would like to learn more just click <a href="https://intellij.com" target="_blank">here</a>), it has nonetheless taught me many important skills such as how to think through problems and different ways that a problem can be solved and their level of optimization.

                <h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
                <p>
                    As this was still the first coding project that I made, there were many challenges that I faced from the beginning. Those included:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Not being familiar with bugs and errors and having difficulties debugging code.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I needed to go to the Computer Science learning centre many times but by the end learned how to read error codes and how to fix bugs.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Figuring out the logic behind certain aspects of the movements of the objects.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While talking with my friends and professor I learned the importance of pseudocode to work through problems and help me figure out where some logic errors might be.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Unfamiliarity with the Processing Library and how to utilize it properly.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Forced me to learn more about the library and the different classes that I could use while making my game.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-well">
                <!--unordered list-->
                <h2>Things that Went Well</h2>
                <p>While there were some issues that I had and lots of stress that I went through, there were some things that went better than I thought they would, such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Setting up the visuals of the game, and making sure that the colors weren't too unflattering.</li>
                        <li>Understanding the logistics of the movement of the pieces and implementing that. Took surprisiningly less time than I thought it would.</li>
                        <li>Cleaning up the code and learning more about how Processing works.</li>
                    </ul>
