            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This was the very first hackathon that I participated in, hosted by <a href="https://shiftkeylabs.ca" target="_blank">Shiftkey Labs</a>, and the first one that I won as well. 
                No one in my group had ever particpated in a hackathon, and we were all quite nervous to see how it would pan out. 
                We said that we would do our best and if we made it to the first round then we woud be grateful.                     At every round we were surprised to hear our group name and be told that we would go onto the next round. 
                Our idea was so innovative and our presentations so convincing that we somehow won first place in that hackathon. 
                While it was a tiring weekend, it was very rewarding and taught me a lot about generative AI, API's, business models and more.

                <h2>Idea</h2>
                    <p>
                        We spent a weekend working on our idea and business model, which combined both healthcare and Generative Artificial Intelligence.
                        Our idea was to create an app that can be used by both healthcare professionals and patients to make scheduling simple and easy. 
                        We wanted to fix the issue of long waiting times and crowding in the waiting rooms of hospitals and clinics.
                        By giving our AI model data about the business of each time period of the day, we can ensure that when a patient is scheduled they are scheduled for the best time without too much crowding.
                        Our program would also allow easy notifications and reminders to the patient if their appointment is cancelled or rescheduled so that they don't have to wait for hours on end without realising that they won't see a physician.

        <h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
        <p>
            <!--ordered list with nested unordered list inside-->
            As this was the very first Hackahton that I participated in and I was unsure what to expect there were many challenges that I ran into, such  as:
            <ol>
                <li>Having differing opinions between team mates and spending lots of time thinking about what the best project to pursue is.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was solved by working through each idea and brainstorming to determine which one would best work with our time and skills.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Once we decided on a project idea, we had to brainstorm with healthcare professionals about wehther it could be implemented into hispitals or not, and spent a lot of time debating about the best course of action.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Talking to the healtcare professional andthe Shiftkey staff helped us tremendously in figuring out the projecion of our idea.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Finally came the stream that we would choose. We were originally plannning on going into the coding route, but were unable to do so because of time constraints, so needed to develop a business plan that showed everything that we wanted it to in the time that we had left.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choosing the non-coding stream ended up being the right choice for us, as we were abel to focus mroe on our idea rather than implementation and stressing about whether it would work or notwhen we demonstrated it.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>

        <h2>Things that Went Well</h2>
        <p>Aside from winning the Hackathon even though it was our first time participating, there were other things that went well for us: 
            <ul>
                <li>Having a physician on-hand to help answer any of our questions and guide us in the right place was a great help to us and motivated us to do well.</li>
                <li>Surveys that we asked others to fill out also greatly helped us in our research portion and explained the issues that were in the healthcare system to us well.</li>
                <li>The overall experience of being in a Hakcathon was a great learning opportunity for us, and it was something that went better than I thought, as I emjoyed it a lot.</li>
            </ul>
